As I talked about in my [last article](/new-year-new-me/) I was aiming for a **70 WPM** avg over 1 min spans 3x in a row as a New Years resolution via [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/). So was I successful?

### The Result

Well I was and it wasn't even close...

### What worked

Looking back on my plan, I think my approach was a successful in that I was able to isolate the components of what drives typing speed. I was able to work the keys up gradually increasing speed almost like a musician would. 

What gave me the biggest speed up besides the initial jump of correct finger placements was **accuracy**. Not having to go back saves precious seconds while maintaining your rhythm so you can stay in a flow state. Once you make a few mistakes and break your rhythm you are much more likely to keep messing up until you reset. One other non obvious thing to think about is what kind of keyboard you are using. I can type way faster on a machanical keyboard where I don't need deep key presses, I have tactile feedback, and most importantly it's not a old piece of junk that is all gummed up and missing keystrokes.

### The Stats

In total I took **15 hours** to complete this challenge. My averages are still skewed from when I was first learning for the majority of my lessons, but I plan to spend at least 5 minutes a day to maintain my skills and slowly push myself further. 

I think **80 WPM** avg is obtainable for me with not too much more work, but any more dedicated study beyond this is just a waste of time and for vanity. 

### Final thoughts

As far as I am concerned, typing no longer limits my thinking and I am saving myself time I can spend on other things now. 

If you are a slow typer, I can personally say that the time investment of a month is more than worth it and you are doing yourself a disservice if you haven't learned touch typing. 

My other resolutions are having steady progress as well. As always, I'll keep you updated soon with some more wins and losses.
