Everyone has big goals for the new year, but what are mine? So far I have been starting off with some smaller goals to help build momentum and skills to obtain my overarching goals.

- 70 WPM 98% accuracy over 1 minute for 3x in a row by Jan 31st
- MIT challenge
- Getting hired
- GYM.

### 1. 70 WPM 98% accuracy over 1 minute 3x in a row by Jan 31st

I want to improve my typing speed and ability to make writing blog posts and programming easier. I noticed that despite some cluster of words being easy from years of experience, I struggle with parts of my keyboard that cause my workflow to break down as well as make me inefficient. As I have been doing more programming, my skill gaps got exposed especially on numbers and punctuation.

In aims of getting there, I first took a base line of my speed (40-45 wpm 95% accuracy). Not bad but I know I can become way more efficient.

A website I found called [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) lets me unlock letters 1 by 1 and increase difficulty over time. The first 10 days of my plan which I started in December I spent getting familiar with typing every letter with the proper finger and slowly working up speed. Surprisingly, my WPM jumped up quite quickly with day after day practice making a big difference. After unlocking all normal letters I was averaging about 60 WPM on a run. This challenge has not only been fun, but super useful for writing this article ;) (~3 times faster)

**Here is where I am now:**
- **Jan 7 - Jan 14**: Work on grammar keys (Using proper shift, period, commas, semicolon etc...)
- **Jan 14 - Jan 21**: Work on problem keys / clusters (Ex: F, P, ! etc.)
- **Jan 21 - Jan 31**: Speed week, put it all together and achieve challenge

### 2. MIT Challenge

Part of my goals are to be a proficient engineer of AI and non AI, so I need some fundamentals to create my own outputs as well as understand and leverage AI outputs. This is where the wealth of knowledge that MIT has online for free will come in handy.

To start, these are the courses I am taking:

- [**6.004** Computation Structures (Spring 2017)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/pages/syllabus/)
- [**6.033** Computer System Engineering (Spring 2018)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-033-computer-system-engineering-spring-2018/)
- [**6.830/6.814** Database Systems (Fall 2010)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-830-database-systems-fall-2010/)
- <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**6.824** Distributed Systems (Spring 2020)</a>

Completing these won't make me an expert by any means, but they theoretically should bolster my decision making with making tradeoffs and help me understand how to design my system's architecture. So far, I am well into 6.004 and based on the view count it surprises me how few people stick it out to the end. I am thoroughly enjoying the course, and it has demystified how computers really work transistor -> the systems we utilize today.

I expect this to take me about 6 months to complete based on my rate of study in between work. My goal is true understanding and application, not just being able to finish the homework. If I finish quicker, I have more courses planned for the rest of the year.

### 3. Get hired

Currently I work part time scraping by to survive while I furiously network and improve my skills. I want to work to not only have a means of survival, but also to put value into society. My webapp GAJA has been a boon so far when sending in apps. Unfortunately, I don't foresee the job market getting better in the near future, so I will need to continue to be diligent with my efforts and positioning to businesses.

### 4. GYM.

Lastly, I have one personal goal to share solely because if I can solve this, I know a lot more is possible for me.

Going to the GYM isn't hard nor is learning effective technique. The difficulty for me specifically is nutrition. If you didn't know I am a particularly big human (6'6"), so I need a lot of calories to be in a surplus to grow muscle at an effective rate and to remedy fatigue. This number is around 3500-4000cals to be exact and it is not easy for me to fit this amount down my esophagus consistently. Not to mention being busy with work and family.

I am putting my foot down to build my eating consistency once and for all to secure my body's health when I am old as well as to find my true physical potential. As a side effect, I find when I am in shape it acts as a multiplier for my other pursuits.

### Final thoughts

While some of these goals are easier than others, put blankly, it's going to be hard. I have plan, the mindset, and the motivation, so I believe in myself and know I will succeed. I'll keep you updated here as I reach my milestones and challenge you to make a few goals for yourself with actionable plans that are **OBTAINABLE** and **CONSISTENT** to follow day after day.
