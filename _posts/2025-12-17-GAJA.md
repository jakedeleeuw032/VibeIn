title: "GAJA: How I vibe coded a job tracker to save people time"

As I prepare to build a mobile app for market, I wanted to get my feet wet with a side project. I decided to build GAJA, a job tracker born out of the frustration of copy pasting data into Excel. The twist? The entire app was vibe coded using AI.  

## Brainstorming

While job hunting I was using an Excel job tracking sheet that would capture data like company, title, salary, etc... The problem that I experienced was it was super tedious managing my window or copy pasting back and forth continuously not to mention formatting issues. I timed it and found it takes 1.5-2 minutes start to finish while being someone who is a computer power user. I could only imagine the exacerbated pain for the less tech savvy.
Heading to the drawing board, I started brainstorming how I could make it one click like Amazon, filling out the tracker instantaneously. While there is probably some weird work around with Excel, I found early on it's going to be hard to interface with sheets and get them allocated to the user. This is where the decision to make it a self contained webapp was made. 

## Early Challenges

After trying to flesh out initial functionalities before building, AI let me know of something called Document Object Model (DOM) and Same Origin Policy (SOP). 
Essentially if I had my app try to interface with a website the request would be blocked, not even being able to simply copy the text, which I assumed was possible due to knowing a little bit about HTML. 
This got me thinking outside of the box and I settled on either a hotkey setup via Autohotkey or a simple browser extension that would copy the text needed through a creative measure (more on this in a bit).

## Let's Build!

Having decided I want a job tracker here are the key features I wanted to implement.
* Authentication for user profiles you can access from anywhere
* CRM system 
	* Stages of application for tracking
	* Edit and saving on the cloud 
	* Filtering 
	* Analytics 
	* Search bar
* 1-2 click data entry 
* Export to CSV 

The easiest part by far was the UI.  Most of the changes and decisions I made were one shot by Google AI Studio as someone who is new to programming. I could change colors, move buttons, and build a table. 
Having tried Cursor 1.0 (more comprehensive and harder tool for a noob), I was fearful of getting hard stuck, which I never did. Only 2 issues took me an hour to solve, mostly with the logic of the database which I wouldn't be surprised were cause by me not knowing what to ask specifically. 

## Version 1: Main Functions Complete

Version 1 looked a bit like this all major functionalities working minus authentication and the automated data entry.

Before moving on to implement the backend, one thing I had quite a fun time with was testing for edge cases. What happens when your job title is super long? Job data missing? Thinking from a users perspective and trying to iron these out was informative. In real development I found that test cases are used as an more objective and complete measure. 

Test case: Tests that live in your code that if the code works correctly it will output no errors. 

This is especially useful if you solve a problem once and edit the main body later. You can see if your edits broke anything important before getting too deep. 

## Version 2: Backend 💀

I thought my luck ended here. After doing some research there is a database hosting service called Firebase that is quite common as well as has a generous free plan perfect for something I won't have generating revenue. Also a part of Google AI Studio was a one click launch to Google Cloud Run (hosting service for your website). 
After first putting in code chunks for Firebase, I was no longer able to effectively test the app inside the sandbox as it has no connectivity with outside API services. My solution at the time was to just keep pushing to the Cloud every change and testing live while deleting the old container. This was not only a pain in the ass, but inefficient and what I know now the wrong way to do it. But trying to get this done using the GAI workspace, I kept on despite getting hard stuck.

This is the first time I had to step back and learn a little more about what I was doing. Fortunately these are common techs, so after some Youtube and chats for troubleshooting I was finally able to convert the local storage to a database on the cloud and authenticate users.

At this point I was feeling pretty good, but the job was far from finished.

As I mentioned earlier I cannot not directly read webpages, but I sure can copy paste the entire webpage for a job description in a textbox that pulls out the relevant info from natural language and cleans it. 
I first tried a Autohotkey set up that runs CTRL A CTRL C CTRL L CTRL C and smashes it together on one clipboard. This worked fine and could even paste it inside the app's textbox, but it required outside software that didn't make it that easy to try. 
You can manually do, while fast still about 10-15 secs.
I settled on a browser extension that does the same functionality Autohotkey, but is easier to set up simply binded to CTRL SHIFT X. At the end of the day it takes two button presses, but for the MVP of making something for fun it's only about 3 seconds in total.

## Final Version

To be honest I had most of this post written somewhere the picture in version 1. It took me almost an extra month to polish the UI, bug fix, user test, and figure out hosting. I absolutely did not want to put out slop, so taking the extra time was worth it. In that time the world moved fast. Google Antigravity IDE was launched and I now develop using it and it's not only sped up the process, but has forced me to learn more about programming and in turn make me less 1 dimensional.
I wanted to post more regularly, but I got hyper focused on the development. Now I'm thinking to follow this up with a update of the tools I'm using and some tips and tricks I've picked up along the way.

## Reflection

While making this wasn't easy, it definitely was easier than I thought it was going to be as well as informative. When I build my mobile app, I will be sure to use a proper repository, write test cases, and research my technology stack and implementation a bit more beforehand.
I am quite proud of what I was able to accomplish cutting down the time from 2 minutes to 2 seconds. Over 100 applications that's 3.2 hours with all of your information in one place for when you need to research.
